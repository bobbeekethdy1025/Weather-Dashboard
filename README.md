Weather-Dashboard is the repository for the 6th challenge assessment that we were given in the bootcamp.

Above this text you will find two links that will take you to the repository that was created to store the codes and files for this challenge.
The latter link will send you to the live webpage for the daily planner that is hosted by github.

Within the repository, you will find an index.html, reset.css, style.css, and script.js.In these files, you will be able to see how the weather application was created with the use of HTML, CSS, JS, and third party APIs.

On the live website you will be shown the title of the application that allows you to search up the name of a city and you will be given the temperature, wind speed, and humidity levels of the searched city. After you search the city, it will be stored in local storage for future uses.

Thank you for taking the time to read this
